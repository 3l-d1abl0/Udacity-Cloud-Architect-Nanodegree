"*** The Problem statement doesn't specifiy the nature of Social Media Platform. For example it can multimedia heavy (like instagram) or text heavy(like Twitter). And it can be Read Heavy or Write Heavy as well.
*** I have designed the Infa asumung the Platform to be Balanced in terms of multimedia and text. 

1.  Downgraded Web servers to t3.large.
	Both (Web n Application Server )EC2 types changed from On-demad to Reserved Instances for 3 years.
	Reduced EBS storage for both the Servers.

2.	Downgraded MySql RDS instance from db.m5.xlarge to db.m5.large. Both master and Replica.
	Switched to Reserved Instance for 3 Years.

3.	Reduced S3 storage TB/month
	Switched to s3 intelligent tiering with the assumtion of 30% of the storage in infrequent Access.
	Leading to reduction of outbound data Transfer by 25%

4.	Reduced the assumed bytes processed on NLB.
	Reduced the estimated number of new connections per minute for NLB.

5.	Reduced the assumed bytes processed on ALB.
	Reduced the estimated number of new connections for Application Load Balancer

6. NOT Removing the Business Support Plan as with reduced Infra, user capacity handling is already low. Removing business support plan may lead to late resolution of any accidental Outages which may affect availability.
