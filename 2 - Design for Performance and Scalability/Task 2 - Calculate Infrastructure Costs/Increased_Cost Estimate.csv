"Enhancements Made :

1. Increased RDS instance to db.m5.2xlarge, both Master and Replica.

2.	Upgraded Web Server Instances to m4.4xlarge, also now each AZ wil have 3 each Web servers and increaded the internal storage as well.
Upgraded Application Instances to m4.4xlarge. Also each AZ will have 3 each Application Servers.
	
3.  Added 6 Elasticache instances to serve frequently used data instead of hitting Database Servers. And to handle user timeline, assuming our social media network has newsfeed.

4.	Added AWS Web Application Firewall to protect the Servers
	
5. CouldWatch - increased number of logs and metrics.

6. Increased S3 storage utilization per month. Added Glacier storage as well to move the infrequent objects to glacier storage after a certain storage period.

7. Adding one RDS more Mysql Instance in another AZ to intoduce redundancy.
