# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information?

From the Docs : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_data-sources.html
"To detect unauthorized and unexpected activity in your AWS environment, GuardDuty analyzes and processes data from AWS CloudTrail event logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs to detect anomalies"

In this case VPC flow logs bucket in S3 would show the logs generated while attempting the attack.
Analyzing the logs would reveal a particular ip attempting SSH on other IP which is Rejected.
