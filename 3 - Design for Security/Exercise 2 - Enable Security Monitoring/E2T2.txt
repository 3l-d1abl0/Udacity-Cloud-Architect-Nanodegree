Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

AttackInstanceSG:
1. Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22

WebAppSG:
1. Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
2. Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389


Ensure the default security group of every VPC restricts all traffic

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

1. If port 22 really needs to be used for ssh, it better to specify the IP of the admin in the Security Group who is Supposed to ssh into it.
Or better yet use Systems Manager to ssh into the EC2 so that all the access to the instances can be tracked.

2. Similarly for if port 3389 needs to be used for incoming traffic, better specify the source IP in the Rules.
Or remove the rule if its not needed at all.

3. The Inbound/Outbound rules for the security group should be deleted and added as and when required.
