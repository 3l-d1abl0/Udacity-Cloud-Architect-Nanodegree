Task 4: Questions and Analysis


1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance?
    -> Placing the Web Application in a Private Subnet and placing a loadbalancer in a Public subnet. which indeed receives direct incoming http/https traffic. In case of web attacks like DDoS the loadbalancer takes the load without hampering the Web Application Server Performance.
    -> Placing a Bastion host in Public subnet with ssh forwarding to the Web Application in Private Subnet. In case of ssh brute force the Bastion Server takes the Load.
    -> If its within the Budget and absolutely necessary then Opt for AWS Shield Advanced.


2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
    -> Creating VPC Endpoint for S3 will not prevent unauthorized access since it will only route the request through Amazon Metwork but the instances will still have access to the Endpoints.


3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
    -> No, it wont affect the Existing Data, only the new incoming Objects will be Encrypted. In order to encrypt the exixting data, they needed to be downloaded and uploaded to the Bucket.

4. The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?
    -> The changes made will be reverted since the Cloudformation templates will create the old stack with Vulnerability.
